# 🛡️ Security Metrics and Validation Framework

## 🎯 Overview
Security in ML is multidimensional. This project provides the tools to measure three critical pillars:
1. **Robustness**: Performance under adversarial attack.
2. **Privacy**: Resistance to data membership inference (Differential Privacy).
3. **Extraction Resistance**: The cost of stealing the model via API queries.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Open `5_Symbols/security_audit_dashboard.ipynb`.
2. Follow the "Acceptance Criteria Framework" in `7_Testing` to see if your model is deployment-ready.
