# 📚 4_Formula: Security Definitions

### 1. Robustness Gap
$$Gap = Accuracy_{clean} - Accuracy_{robust}$$
*Low gap indicates high resilience.*

### 2. Differential Privacy (DP)
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-Differential Privacy ensures that the probability of an outcome changes by at most $e^\epsilon$ when one individual is added or removed, with a small failure probability $\delta$.

### 3. Extraction Cost
$$Cost = (Queries \times Cost\_Per\_Query)$$
*Higher cost increases the 'economic' security of the model.*
