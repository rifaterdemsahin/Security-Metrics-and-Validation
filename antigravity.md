# 📂 Project Structure: Security-First Development

This project uses a seven-stage workflow to move from abstract security goals to validated, robust machine learning deployments.

### 🎯 1_Real: Objectives
- **Premise:** Security is not an afterthought. We define what "safe" looks like before writing code.
- **Metric:** Defining the "Acceptable Risk" thresholds.

### 🗺️ 2_Environment: Roadmap
- **Premise:** Planning the attack surface and defense tools (e.g., Adversarial Robustness Toolbox).

### 🧠 3_UI: Knowledge Acquisition
- **Premise:** The notebook serves as the interactive dashboard for security analysis.

### 📚 4_Formula: The Math of Defense
- **Premise:** Formalizing metrics like the Robustness Gap and Differential Privacy ($\epsilon$, $\delta$).

### 💻 5_Symbols: Implementation
- **Premise:** The code that calculates metrics and simulates adversarial conditions.

### 🐞 6_Semblance: The Privacy-Utility Trade-off
- **Premise:** Documenting the balance between high security and model performance.

### ✅ 7_Testing: Final Validation
- **Premise:** Auditing the model against the "Acceptance Criteria Framework."
